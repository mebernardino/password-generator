# Password Generator 

A simple password generator web application built using Python's Flask framework based on my Stanford Code In Place final project. It allows users to generate a secure password with options for character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) and allows them to set the desired length.

- Python 3.13
